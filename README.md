# Etch A Sketch

The Etch A Sketch project is a web-based application that simulates a sketchpad where users can draw by interacting with a grid of squares. Each square changes color upon interaction, providing a fun and dynamic drawing experience. This project helps in practicing DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

## Features

- Draw on a grid by moving the mouse over the squares.
- Randomize the color of each square with every interaction.
- Implement a progressive darkening effect, where each interaction darkens the square by 10%.
